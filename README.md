    * AFTIR model that just has drug and target, but includes distribution to a target tissue.  
    * Some of the code, especially AFIRT_calculation.R may be helpful here.

pgm_ModelG - this contains code for the 2018 Hackathon
    * it currently contains some example code
    * Task01, Task02, Task03 are for ModelF from 2017.  It just illustrates some different plots that may be useful
